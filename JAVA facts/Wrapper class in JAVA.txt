Wrapper classes are the classes that cover some class. For example Integer class wraps the
primitive data type int. A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains a primitive data types.
When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field, 
we can store a primitive data types.

Why need wrapper class?
1. Converts the primitive data types into objects. Objects are needed when we wish to modify
the args passed into the method.
2. java.util package handles only objects.
3. Data structures such as ArrayList and Vector handles storing only objects.
4. Objects are needed for synchronisation in multithreading.

Conversion of primitive data types into its corresponding wrapper class is called as 
autoboxing. The reverse process is known as unboxing.
