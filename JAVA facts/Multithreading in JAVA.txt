A thread is a unit of a process.
Highly used in Async tasks in android.

Ways to achieve multithreading in JAVA:
1. Extend your class with class Thread.
2. Since multiple inheritence is not supported in JAVA, we can use Runnable interface as well.

Every JAVA program has atleast 1 thread by default i.e. the main thread.

For multithreading, the default method which executes when we use thread.start() is the run() method.
