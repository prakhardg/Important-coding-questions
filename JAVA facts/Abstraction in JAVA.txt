Abstraction means hiding the complex details from the user. It simplifies work at
design level.
Those methods which are declared but not defined are abstract methods.
Class having abstract method are abstract classes. Cannot create object of abstract class.

Suppose someone expects more methods to be available in a class, but has no idea how to implement
them. So he should just create abstract methods and put them into the abstract class.
Next time whenever someone wants to implement them, they must inherit the abstract class and 
start implementing the methods and then use this to create a new object.
