We know that multiple inheritence is not supported in JAVA because:
1. Suppose there are two different methods in class A and B but both have the same name.
In that case, the child class will be confused wether to call the method from A or B.
Hence the multiple inheritence is not supported in JAVA.

We can get multiple inheritence using Interface:
Interface is just like class but all the methods in the interface are only declared but not
defined, i.e they all remain abstract.
Since abstract methods must be defined explicitly in all the child classes, therefore
there is no confusion about which abstract method must be called.

You can implement several interfaces in the same class and all the methods(union of all)
must be implemented in the child class. Or you can make the child class as abstract.
Then this abstract class can be later extended by the child of this child class.
