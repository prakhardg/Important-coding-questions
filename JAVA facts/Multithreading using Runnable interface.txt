Since we cannot do multiple inheritence in JAVA therefore it is not always possible to extend
the Thread class in your class. Therefore Runnable interface solves this problem.

See here: https://ideone.com/imYQSN

In the runnable interface, there is an abstract method called run which is called whenever the
thread.start() method is called. Make sure the objects to be linked to the threads are passed
as args of the constructor to link the objects with the thread. The concerned class implements
Runnable interface.
