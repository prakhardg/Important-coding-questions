There are three types of variables in JAVA: Instance, local and class

Instance: The variable inside a class as an attribute of every object. 
	  Example: Age is a local variable if we have a student class.

Local: The local variables are the params in the method which we pass values to.

Class: The class variables are those which do not vary for every object and are associated
	with the class. Example: Suppose we want to keep record of number of objects
	of the class created. Mainly class variables are static variables.
