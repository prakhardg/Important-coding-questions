throws is a keyword in JAVA which suppresses the error. Try catch is better because with try
and catch we can also handle the error. throw is used to forcibly throw an error.
Example:

try{
k = i+j
(if k> 10)
throw new ArithmeticException();
}

catch(ArithmeticException e){
System.out.print("Value should be greater than 10\n");
}
