There are three ways in which we can copy an object in JAVA
1. Shallow copy
2. Deep Copy
3. Cloning.

Shallow copy does not create 2 different objects in the heap but only creates two references
to the same objects.
Ex. MyClass obj1 = obj;
Any changes in obj will be reflected in the obj1 as well.

In deep copy, we create 2 different objects in the heap memory. We manually create 2 different
objects by copying values one by one.


Third is cloning, which creates a new object and which is an exact clone of the object.
Ex. Myclass.obj1 = obj.clone();
Cloning is the hybrid version of shallow and deep copy.
