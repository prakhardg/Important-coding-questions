There are basically two types of objects: Referenced and Anonymous.
Referenced objects are those which we actually create and they take up space in the
stack memory.
Ex: Student student  =new Student()

If unused, the referenced object is not eligible for garbage collection.

However suppose if we want to use some object only once, it is better to use Anonymous
object, since it does not take space in stack memory, and takes only heap memory.
Ex: new Class.method();
Here we did not create a referenced object. As soon as the usage is complete, it will be cleared
via garbage collection process of JVM
