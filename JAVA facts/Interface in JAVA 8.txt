We know that all the functions in an interface should be abstract. However JAVA 8 supports
method definition in interface, provided they have a default keyword. Works only for JAVA 8
and above(whenever it comes)

Information 2: Suppose there is a class C extends A implements B. Interface B has a default 
defined method ( show() ) and class A has a method named ( show() ). Then class method has 
higher priority than default interface methods

Information 3: If your interface has any method which overrides the Objects class methods then
you get an error.
